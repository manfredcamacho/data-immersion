# Data Immersion with Python

In this course, we had the opportunity to dive into the world of Data Science and develop our first project from scratch in just four days. The course started with the basics, making it perfect for beginners, and covered a range of more advanced topics. After each class, we were given challenges to help us practice what we had learned. It was a great way to apply the concepts we had learned and to build our skills in a practical way. It was an amazing experience that allowed me to learn more about the exciting field of Data Science.
